### Understanding the Problem

#### Part 1: Reverse Order Representation
You have two numbers represented as linked lists where:
- Each node contains a single digit (0-9)
- The digits are stored in **reverse order** (least significant digit first)

**Example:**
```
Number 1: 7 → 1 → 6  
(represents 617, because 7 is 1's place, 1 is 10's place, 6 is 100's place)

Number 2: 5 → 9 → 2  
(represents 295, because 5 is 1's place, 9 is 10's place, 2 is 100's place)
```

**Sum Calculation:**
```
  617
+ 295
= 912
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 → 1 → 9  
(since 2 is 1's place, 1 is 10's place, 9 is 100's place of the sum 912)
```

#### Key Points for Reverse Order:
1. The head of the list is the **1's digit** (rightmost digit in normal number representation)
2. Addition proceeds from **least significant to most significant digit** (just like how 
   you'd add numbers on paper from right to left)
3. You need to handle **carry-over** when the sum of digits ≥ 10

#### Part 2: Forward Order Representation (Follow-up)
Now the digits are stored in **normal order** (most significant digit first):

**Example:**
```
Number 1: 6 → 1 → 7  
(represents 617 normally)

Number 2: 2 → 9 → 5  
(represents 295 normally)
```

**Sum Calculation:**
```
  617
+ 295
= 912
```

**Expected Output:**
```
9 → 1 → 2  
(most significant digit first)
```

#### Key Differences for Forward Order:
1. The head of the list is now the **most significant digit**
2. Addition must proceed from **most to least significant digit** (left to right)
3. Handling carry-over becomes trickier because you can't easily propagate carries backward
4. You might need to:
   - Reverse the lists first (convert to Part 1 problem)
   - Use recursion to handle the carry from least to most significant digit
   - Use a stack to process digits in reverse order

### Problem Requirements Summary
1. **Reverse Order Case**:
   - Input: Two numbers as linked lists with digits in reverse order
   - Output: Sum as a linked list in reverse order
   - Approach: Simple digit-by-digit addition with carry propagation

2. **Forward Order Case (Follow-up)**:
   - Input: Two numbers as linked lists with digits in normal order
   - Output: Sum as a linked list in normal order
   - Approach: More complex due to carry propagation direction (may need recursion/stacks)

### Visual Comparison

| Case          | Number Representation | Example Input | Interpretation | Expected Output |
|---------------|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Reverse Order | Least significant digit first | 7→1→6 + 5→9→2 | 617 + 295 | 2→1→9 (912) |
| Forward Order | Most significant digit first  | 6→1→7 + 2→9→5 | 617 + 295 | 9→1→2 (912) |

The core challenge is adapting the addition algorithm to the digit storage order while 
properly handling carry-over between place values.
