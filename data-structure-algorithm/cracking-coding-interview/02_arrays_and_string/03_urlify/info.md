Clarifying the purpose of this line:

```java
if (trueLength < str.length)  str[trueLength] = '\0';
```

### What Does This Line Do?
This line adds a **null terminator** (`\0`) at the position `trueLength` in the `char[] str`
array. A null terminator is a special character used in many programming languages 
(like C and C++) to mark the end of a string. In Java, strings are not null-terminated, 
but this line is still used as a safety measure in this specific algorithm.

---

### Why Is This Line Needed?

1. **Extra Space in the Array:**
   - The input `char[] str` has extra space at the end to accommodate the additional 
     characters (`%20`) that will replace spaces.
   - For example, in the input `"Mr John Smith    "`, the true string is `"Mr John Smith"`
     (length 13), but the array has extra spaces at the end to make room for the replacements.

2. **Preventing Garbage Values:**
   - If the `trueLength` is less than the total length of the array (`str.length`), the extra 
     space in the array might contain **garbage values** (uninitialized or leftover data).
   - By adding a null terminator (`\0`) at the position `trueLength`, we ensure that any 
     garbage values beyond this point are ignored.

3. **Ensuring Proper String Termination:**
   - While Java strings are not null-terminated, this line is a safeguard to ensure that
     the modified string doesn’t include unintended characters from the extra space in the array.

### Example:

#### Input:
```java
String str = "Mr John Smith    ";
char[] arr = str.toCharArray();
int trueLength = 13; // "Mr John Smith" (excluding trailing spaces)
```

#### Before Replacement:
The `char[] arr` looks like this:
```
['M', 'r', ' ', 'J', 'o', 'h', 'n', ' ', 'S', 'm', 'i', 't', 'h', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']
```
- The first 13 characters (`trueLength`) are the actual string: `"Mr John Smith"`.
- The remaining spaces (`' ', ' ', ' ', ' '`) are extra space to accommodate the replacements.

#### After Adding Null Terminator:
When the line `if (trueLength < str.length)  str[trueLength] = '\0';` is executed:
- `trueLength` is 13, and `str.length` is 17 (since there are 4 extra spaces).
- A null terminator (`\0`) is added at index 13:
```
['M', 'r', ' ', 'J', 'o', 'h', 'n', ' ', 'S', 'm', 'i', 't', 'h', '\0', ' ', ' ', ' ']
```

#### Why This Matters:
- During the replacement process, the algorithm iterates backwards and writes the new 
  characters (`%20`) into the array.
- The null terminator ensures that any garbage values beyond `trueLength` are ignored, 
  and the modified string is correctly formed.

---

### When Is This Line Not Needed?
- If the `trueLength` is equal to the length of the array (`str.length`), there is no 
  extra space, so this line is skipped.
- In Java, strings are not null-terminated, so this line is more of a precautionary 
  measure to handle cases where the array has extra space.

---

### Summary:
The line `if (trueLength < str.length)  str[trueLength] = '\0';` is a **safety measure** to:
1. Ignore any garbage values in the extra space of the array.
2. Ensure the modified string is properly formed and doesn’t include unintended characters.
