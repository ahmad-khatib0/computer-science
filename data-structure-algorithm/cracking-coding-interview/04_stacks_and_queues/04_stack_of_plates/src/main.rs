// Stack of Plates: I magine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high,
// it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when
// the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks
// that mimics this. SetOfSta c ks should be composed of several stacks and should create
// a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks . push( ) and
// SetOfStacks. pop() should behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop()
// should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).
//
// FOLLOW UP
// Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop
// operation on a specific subÂ­stack
//
